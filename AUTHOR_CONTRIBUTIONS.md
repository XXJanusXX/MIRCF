## Contribution Statement

**Conceptualization**  
The author conceived the Meta-Intentional Reflexive Cybernetic Framework (MIRCF), including the core ideas of reflexive stability, entropy regulation, intrinsic safety, and long-horizon sustainability in recursive and distributed intelligent systems.

**Theoretical Development**  
The author developed the mathematical and cybernetic foundations of MIRCF, including the formulation of reflexive control operators, stability arguments, entropy drift bounds, and the structural mapping to quantum-inspired dynamics.

**Methodology**  
The author designed the experimental methodology following a Design Science Research (DSR) paradigm, including research questions, evaluation metrics, ablation studies, counterfactual failure analysis, and scalability experiments.

**Software and Implementation**  
The author implemented all simulation code, notebooks, quantum-inspired extensions, table and figure generation pipelines, checksum validation scripts, and continuous integration workflows. All code was written to support deterministic, reproducible execution.

**Data Curation**  
The author generated, curated, and validated all experimental outputs, including figures, tables, and derived metrics. No external datasets were used.

**Validation and Verification**  
The author conducted systematic validation of results through controlled ablation, counterfactual analysis, checksum verification, and continuous integration testing to ensure correctness and reproducibility.

**Visualization**  
The author designed and produced all figures and tables reported in the paper (Figures 6.1–6.9), ensuring publication-quality vector and high-resolution raster outputs.

**Writing – Original Draft**  
The author wrote the original manuscript, including theoretical exposition, methodology, results, discussion, and conclusions.

**Writing – Review & Editing**  
The author reviewed, revised, and refined the manuscript and accompanying research artifacts for clarity, rigor, and submission readiness.

**Project Administration**  
The author managed the overall research project, including version control, artifact organization, documentation, and archival preparation.
